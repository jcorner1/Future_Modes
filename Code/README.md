# Notebook Series and Order
This is to help delineate the different series of notebooks used to create the plots, figures, and other results from this study. There are other miscellaneous notebooks also provided.

## Model Creation
It is important to note that two different computer systems were used for this project. Triton is an EAE department at NIU resource that contains the WRF-BCC dataset. Jetstream is a Unidata/UCAR resource with access to a GPU.

Some of these could have been run on either system. This just simply reports how it was done in this study.
